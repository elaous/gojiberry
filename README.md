# gojiberry / gox

A JSX-for-Go: write `<div>...</div>` tags directly in Go source as an
expression, anywhere a Go expression is legal, compiling down to plain
Go that renders identically on the server (HTML strings) and in the
browser (real DOM, via WASM), with no separate template language.

```go
func Greeting(props GreetingProps) gox.Node {
	if props.Name == "" {
		return <p class="greeting">Hello, stranger!</p>
	}
	return <p class="greeting">Hello, {props.Name}!</p>
}
```

## Why tags can just be Go expressions

Go's generics use `Foo[T]`, not `Foo<T>`, so unlike TSX there's no
ambiguity between a tag and a generic instantiation to resolve. The
only remaining question is distinguishing a tag-open from the
less-than operator (`a < b`), which `.gox` resolves the same way JSX
parsers do: `<` only means "less than" immediately after something
that completes a value (an identifier, a literal, or a closing
`)`/`]`/`}`). Everywhere else — after `return`, `(`, `,`, `=`, `{`, or
at the start of a statement — a `<` can only legally begin a new
expression, so that's exactly where a tag is allowed to start.

`{expr}` holes, in both attribute values and child position, are
always a single Go expression, exactly like JSX. There's no separate
`if`/`for` template syntax: loops and conditionals are ordinary Go,
usually via an inline closure —

```go
<ul>{func() []gox.Node {
	var items []gox.Node
	for _, s := range list {
		items = append(items, <li>{s}</li>)
	}
	return items
}()}</ul>
```

— which is itself just a Go expression, so tags inside its body are
expanded by the same recursive scan, with no extra grammar required.

## Packages

- **`gox`** — the runtime. `Node` is a plain, renderer-agnostic tree
  (element / text / fragment / raw) that both the server and the
  client render from, so a component behaves identically either way.
  `gox.Render`/`gox.RenderString` render to HTML with automatic
  escaping (`gox.Raw` is the explicit escape hatch). `gox.Event.Value`
  is `any`, read back type-safely via `gox.EventValue[T]`.
- **`internal/transpile`** — the `.gox` → `.go` source-to-source
  transpiler described above.
- **`cmd/goxc`** — the CLI: `go run ./cmd/goxc <dir>` transpiles every
  `*.gox` under `<dir>` into a gofmt-clean `*.gox.go` next to it (the
  generated file is committed, like `templ`'s `*_templ.go` convention,
  so `go build`/`go test` work without running goxc first). Wired up
  as `go generate` via the repo-root `generate.go`.
- **`domrt`** — the client runtime (`GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm` only).
  `domrt.Mount` creates real DOM nodes for a `gox.Node` tree;
  `Root.Update` diffs the next tree against what's live and patches
  only what changed — text content in place, attributes added/removed,
  event listeners registered at most once per (element, event) with
  the Go closure swapped on later renders, and children reconciled by
  key when present — preserving DOM node identity (focus, scroll
  position, input state) wherever the shape didn't change.
- **`domrt/browser`** (`GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm`) — `browser.Global(name)`
  exposes any global browser API by name (e.g. `Global("WebAssembly")`)
  for one-offs; typed wrappers cover the APIs most apps need: `Fetch`/
  `Response.Text`/`Response.JSON`, `LocalStorage`/`SessionStorage`, and
  `Connect` (WebSocket).
- **`domrt/sw`** (`GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm`) — lets a Go/WASM binary run as
  a browser service worker: `OnInstall`/`OnActivate`/`OnFetch` register
  the lifecycle/fetch events, `ExtendableEvent.WaitUntil` and
  `FetchEvent.RespondWith` bridge to `event.waitUntil`/`respondWith`,
  and `CachesOpen`/`CacheAddAll`/`CachesMatch`/`ClaimClients` wrap the
  Cache Storage API. `domrt.Await`/`domrt.ToPromise` (in the `domrt`
  package itself) bridge JS Promises in both directions and are shared
  by `browser` and `sw` rather than duplicated.

## Components

A component is a plain Go function taking a typed props struct:

```go
type ButtonProps struct {
	Label   string
	OnClick gox.EventHandler
}

func Button(props ButtonProps) gox.Node {
	return <button onClick={props.OnClick}>{props.Label}</button>
}
```

`<Button label="Save" onClick={handleSave}/>` (uppercase tag name)
compiles to `Button(ButtonProps{Label: "Save", OnClick: handleSave})` —
attribute names map to struct fields by capitalizing the first letter.
If the tag has children, they're collected into a `Children
[]gox.Node` field. Lowercase tag names (`<div>`, `<span>`, custom
elements like `<my-widget>`) are real HTML elements and compile to
`gox.El(...)` instead.

## Examples

- `examples/ssr-demo` — components with props, a conditional branch,
  and a rendered list, run server-side:

  ```
  go generate ./...
  go run ./examples/ssr-demo
  go test ./examples/ssr-demo/...
  ```

- `examples/wasm-counter` — a stateful counter compiled to WASM and
  mounted client-side, proving domrt's diff/patch against a real
  browser:

  ```
  go generate ./...
  GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o examples/wasm-counter/main.wasm ./examples/wasm-counter/
  cp "$(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js" examples/wasm-counter/
  cd examples/wasm-counter && python3 -m http.server 8080
  # open http://localhost:8080/
  ```

- `examples/wasm-browser-api-demo` — `domrt/browser`'s `Fetch` and
  `LocalStorage` wrappers, reading a local `config.json` and round
  -tripping a stored value:

  ```
  go generate ./...
  GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o examples/wasm-browser-api-demo/main.wasm ./examples/wasm-browser-api-demo/
  cp "$(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js" examples/wasm-browser-api-demo/
  cd examples/wasm-browser-api-demo && python3 -m http.server 8080
  # open http://localhost:8080/
  ```

- `examples/wasm-sw-demo` — a cache-first service worker compiled from
  `.gox`, proving a Go/WASM binary can run as a real browser service
  worker (not just page-context script):

  ```
  go generate ./...
  GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o examples/wasm-sw-demo/sw.wasm ./examples/wasm-sw-demo/
  cp "$(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js" examples/wasm-sw-demo/
  cd examples/wasm-sw-demo && python3 -m http.server 8080
  # open http://localhost:8080/ -- devtools > Application > Service Workers
  # shows it installed, activated, and claimed the page.
  ```

## Known limitations (v1)

- Generated `.go` files don't yet carry `//line` directives, so a
  panic inside transpiled code reports a line number in the generated
  file, not the original `.gox` source.
- No editor/LSP support yet (syntax highlighting, completion) — write
  `.gox` as plain text and let `go generate` + `go build` catch
  mistakes.
- Children/attribute list diffing in `domrt` is a straightforward
  keyed-or-positional reconciliation, not a minimal-move (LIS-based)
  algorithm — correct, but not necessarily the fewest possible DOM
  moves for a heavily-reordered keyed list.
